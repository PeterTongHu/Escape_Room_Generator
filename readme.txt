	There is no shortcut commands; however, you can click on "New Design" to go into room position planning mode directly, "continue" and choose a file named "continue.dat" to get into design room mode directly, or "play" and choose a file named "video.dat" to get into player mode directly. By using these files, you can get into any mode you want for purpose of shortcut or game-playing.
